%%% For print copies
%% set 'singlespace' option to set entire thesis to single space, and define "\printmode" to remove all hyperlinks for printed copies of the thesis. Delete all output files before changing this mode -- it will turn hyperref package on and off
%\documentclass[12pt,lot, lof, singlespace]{puthesis}
%\newcommand{\printmode}{}

%%% For the electronic copy, use doublespacing, define "\proquestmode" to use outlined links, instead of colored links. 
\documentclass[12pt,lot, lof]{quthesis}
\newcommand{\proquestmode}{}
% I prefer proquestmode to be off for electronic copies for normal use, since the colored links are less distracting. However when printed in black and white, the colored links are difficult to read. 

%%% For early drafts without some of the frontmatter
% Also see the "ifodd" command below to disable more frontmatter
%\documentclass[12pt]{puthesis}

%%%% Tweak float placements
% From: http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/bibliog/latex/floats.html "Controlling LaTeX Floats"
% and based on: http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=floats
% LaTeX defaults listed at: http://people.cs.uu.nl/piet/floats/node1.html

% Alter some LaTeX defaults for better treatment of figures:
    % See p.105 of "TeX Unbound" for suggested values.
    % See pp. 199-200 of Lamport's "LaTeX" book for details.
    %   General parameters, for ALL pages:
    \renewcommand{\topfraction}{0.85}	% max fraction of floats at top
    \renewcommand{\bottomfraction}{0.6}	% max fraction of floats at bottom
    %   Parameters for TEXT pages (not float pages):
    \setcounter{topnumber}{2}
    \setcounter{bottomnumber}{2}
    \setcounter{totalnumber}{4}     % 2 may work better
    \setcounter{dbltopnumber}{2}    % for 2-column pages
    \renewcommand{\dbltopfraction}{0.66}	% fit big float above 2-col. text
    \renewcommand{\textfraction}{0.15}	% allow minimal text w. figs
    %   Parameters for FLOAT pages (not text pages):
    \renewcommand{\floatpagefraction}{0.66}	% require fuller float pages
	% N.B.: floatpagefraction MUST be less than topfraction !!
    \renewcommand{\dblfloatpagefraction}{0.66}	% require fuller float pages

% The documentclass already sets parameters to make a high penalty for widows and orphans. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\
%%%% Use packages

%\usepackage{amsfonts}

%%% For figures
\usepackage{graphicx}
%\usepackage{subfig,rotate}

%%% for comments
\usepackage{verbatim}

%%% For tables
\usepackage{multirow}
% Longtable lets you have tables that span multiple pages.
\usepackage{longtable}

% Booktabs produces far nicer tables than the standard LaTeX tables.
%   see: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Tables
\usepackage{booktabs}

%set parameters for longtable:
% default caption width is 4in for longtable, but wider for normal tables
\setlength{\LTcapwidth}{\textwidth}

%%%% Define commands

% create an environment that will indent text

\makefrontmatter


% \include lets us split up the document (and each include starts a new page):
\chapter{Introduction}
This component summarizes the research problem the student is addressing in the Thesis/Dissertation. This should clearly define the research problem(s), and unambiguously state the rationale and objectives of the research. The introduction should also provide a context to prepare the readers upfront on what are expected in the rest of the Thesis/Dissertation including a break-down of the proposed solutions into parts that could be explained in the latter chapters.

\chapter{Background and/or Literature Survey}
A comprehensive review of the relevant literature according to disciplinary norms containing the weaknesses/deficiencies of existing work related to the research problem(s) addressed in the Thesis/Dissertation. It includes an account on how others have addressed this or similar problem(s), which approach(es) were used, etc.

\chapter{Approach/Methodology}
The research approach/methodology is a tool or a set of tools and techniques that are used to conduct research. The thesis should describe which approach(s)/methodologies are adapted in this research, why these are selected over others, how these are applied in the research.

\chapter{Implementation/Research Findings}
This component can be presented in more than one chapter which could clearly present the findings of the research with adequate data. It includes a description on how the approach has been applied/implemented, algorithms, architectures, process diagrams etc.

\chapter{Evaluation/Validation}
This component should provide an account on how the findings have been evaluated, tested, and finally validated. The data of the verification /testing/ experiment should also be presented with adequate explanation.

\chapter{Discussion}
An in-depth scholarly discussion on the findings should be provided along with future research directions. It should also include a detailsâ€™ account on why the findings of the Thesis/Dissertation are better than the previous or exiting results done by others.

\chapter{Conclusion}
This component should restate the major theme and findings of the Thesis/Dissertation, and pull the entire Thesis/Dissertation together.
