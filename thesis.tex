%%%% Tweak float placements
% From: http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/bibliog/latex/floats.html "Controlling LaTeX Floats"
% and based on: http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=floats
% LaTeX defaults listed at: http://people.cs.uu.nl/piet/floats/node1.html

% Alter some LaTeX defaults for better treatment of figures:
    % See p.105 of "TeX Unbound" for suggested values.
    % See pp. 199-200 of Lamport's "LaTeX" book for details.
    %   General parameters, for ALL pages:
    \renewcommand{\topfraction}{0.85}	% max fraction of floats at top
    \renewcommand{\bottomfraction}{0.6}	% max fraction of floats at bottom
    %   Parameters for TEXT pages (not float pages):
    \setcounter{topnumber}{2}
    \setcounter{bottomnumber}{2}
    \setcounter{totalnumber}{4}     % 2 may work better
    \setcounter{dbltopnumber}{2}    % for 2-column pages
    \renewcommand{\dbltopfraction}{0.66}	% fit big float above 2-col. text
    \renewcommand{\textfraction}{0.15}	% allow minimal text w. figs
    %   Parameters for FLOAT pages (not text pages):
    \renewcommand{\floatpagefraction}{0.66}	% require fuller float pages
	% N.B.: floatpagefraction MUST be less than topfraction !!
    \renewcommand{\dblfloatpagefraction}{0.66}	% require fuller float pages

% The documentclass already sets parameters to make a high penalty for widows and orphans.

%%%% Use packages

%\usepackage{amsfonts}

%%% For figures
\usepackage{graphicx}
%\usepackage{subfig,rotate}

%%% for comments
\usepackage{verbatim}

%%% For tables
\usepackage{multirow}
% Longtable lets you have tables that span multiple pages.
\usepackage{longtable}

% Booktabs produces far nicer tables than the standard LaTeX tables.
%   see: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Tables
\usepackage{booktabs}

%set parameters for longtable:
% default caption width is 4in for longtable, but wider for normal tables
\setlength{\LTcapwidth}{\textwidth}

% url package understands urls (with proper line-breaks) without hyperlinking them
\usepackage{url}
